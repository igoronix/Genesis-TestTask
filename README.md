Further Details

Application should consists of one or two screens. On the main screen the users see state of the application: idle, playing, recording, paused; two controls that allow the users to choose duration of sleep timer in minutes and the recording duration; and the play/pause button.

The users set desired parameters, tap play button and application starts playing the sound of a nature during sleep timer duration in a loop. When the sound is finished, application starts recording audio. When recording time is finished, the application should transit back to idle state. The recording should start in background mode as well, after the sound of nature is completed.

Tapping on play/pause should start the entire flow or pause playing or recording.

Everything should work in background as well. If the playing or recording is interrupted by another application using audio session, try to restore application state gracefully.

You should provide a way to switch off playing the sound of nature completely.

Audio records should be put in user Documents folder and be available via iTunes file sharing.
